The project aims to develop a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for the comprehensive inspection of underwater environments. This ROV is equipped with advanced
features, including a camera, lighting, thrusters, and a range of sensors, enabling it to
assess the condition of underwater environments with precision and reliability. The
primary goal of this project is to perform the underwater inspection using ROV. This
inspection using an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) has a significant
application in ship hull inspection. The project aims to gather highly accurate data
for the targeted identification of areas that require repair or maintenance. By using
the ROV, we can perform ship hull inspection with precision, which will help us
identify areas in need of repair or maintenance more efficiently. Also, we can use
this underwater ROV during the time of the heavy flood, during which we can gather
all information about the submerged materials under the water. This capability is
essential for assessing damages, understanding underwater conditions, and informing
flood management decisions. Overall, this innovative technology proves to be an ideal
solution for both underwater exploration and inspections, offering enhanced safety and
data collection capabilities. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can increase safety
by eliminating the need for human divers and broadening data collection capacities,
allowing for a more accurate understanding of submerged environments.
